# 🧠 My LLM Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository for exploring Large Language Models (LLMs)! 🌟

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is my playground for learning about:

- OpenAI's technologies 🤖
- Anthropic's innovations 🧬
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 📚
- ...and everything else LLM-related! 🌈

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `python setup.py`
   - This will create a `.env` file, set up a virtual environment, and install requirements
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Start exploring! 🕵️‍♂️

## 🌟 Highlight: OpenAI Function Calling

Check out the `functions-tools-agents-with-langchain` folder to see my work on OpenAI's function calling feature!
