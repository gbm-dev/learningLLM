# IPAM Project Checklist

## Pydantic Types and Features
- [ ] IPvAnyAddress for IP address fields
- [ ] constr for constrained string fields (e.g., hostnames)
- [ ] conint for integer fields with constraints (e.g., VLAN IDs)
- [ ] Optional for fields that aren't required
- [ ] List for fields that contain multiple items
- [ ] Field for additional field constraints and metadata
- [ ] validator decorator for custom field validation
- [ ] root_validator for model-wide validation
- [ ] Config class for model configuration (e.g., allow_mutation=False for immutable models)

## Pydantic Validators
- [ ] Custom validator for subnet/network address
- [ ] Custom validator for MAC addresses
- [ ] Validator for ensuring unique IP addresses within a subnet
- [ ] Validator for VLAN ID range (1-4094)

## Python Native Features
- [ ] Docstrings for all classes and functions
- [ ] Type hints for function parameters and return values
- [ ] Lambda functions for simple operations
- [ ] List comprehensions for concise list operations
- [ ] f-strings for string formatting
- [ ] try/except blocks for error handling
- [ ] with statements for context management (e.g., file operations)
- [ ] Enumeration classes for predefined choices (e.g., device types)

## Python Standard Library Modules
- [ ] ipaddress module for IP address and network operations
- [ ] argparse for command-line argument parsing
- [ ] json for JSON data handling
- [ ] csv for CSV file operations
- [ ] logging for application logging

## Object-Oriented Programming
- [ ] Class inheritance for specialized models
- [ ] Property decorators for computed attributes
- [ ] Static methods for utility functions
- [ ] Class methods for alternative constructors

## Error Handling
- [ ] Custom exception classes for IPAM-specific errors
- [ ] Detailed error messages for validation failures

## Data Persistence
- [ ] JSON file storage for saving IPAM data
- [ ] Data loading and saving functions

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for Pydantic models
- [ ] Unit tests for IPAM operations
- [ ] Test cases for edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation
- [ ] README.md file with project description and usage instructions
- [ ] Inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Function annotations for additional context

## Code Organization
- [ ] Separate modules for models, operations, and CLI interface
- [ ] `__init__.py` files for proper module structure
- [ ] Constants defined at the top of the file or in a separate constants.py

## Best Practices
- [ ] PEP 8 compliance for code style
- [ ] Use of `if __name__ == "__main__":` for script execution
- [ ] Type checking with mypy
- [ ] Use of `__all__` for controlling module exports

## Advanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] Async support for potential future database operations
- [ ] Custom Pydantic types for domain-specific data (e.g., IPRange)
- [ ] Integration with external libraries (e.g., rich for enhanced CLI output)
- [ ] Use of `__slots__` for memory optimization in frequently instantiated classes
